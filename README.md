# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on mastering Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It includes documentation, diagrams, and structured requirements for a booking management system, emphasizing clarity, precision, and alignment with business goals. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for successful project execution through real-world application of requirement analysis principles.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a key phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where project needs are gathered, documented, and analyzed to define the scope and objectives clearly. It ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and potential challenges.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is important because of its:
  - **Clarity**: Defines precise expectations and project scope.
  - **Risk Reduction**: Identifies issues early, avoiding costly changes later.
  - **Efficiency**: Guides development with clear requirements, reducing errors.
  - **Alignment**: Ensures software meets user needs and business goals.
  - **Testing Support**: Simplifies test case creation and product validation.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several critical activities to ensure the software meets its objectives effectively. Below are the five key activities:
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collect project needs from stakeholders and users.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Uncover explicit and implicit requirements through interviews, surveys, or workshops.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Record requirements clearly in formats like user stories or specifications.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Identify gaps and conflicts; create diagrams to visualize system interactions.
- **Requirement Validation**: Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure clarity, feasibility, and alignment with goals.

## Types of Requirements:
**Functional Requirements**: define the specific behavior or functions of the system. These describe what the system should do to meet user needs.
  Examples:
  - **Search hotels by location, price, or amenities.**
  - **Update hotel details via a manager portal.**
  - **Book hotels and process payments securely.**
  - **Send notifications for bookings or offers.**
  - **View current and past bookings.**

**Non-functional Requirements**: focus on the quality attributes of the system. These describe how the system performs its functions.
  Examples:
  - **Performance**: Handle 10,000+ users simultaneously.
  - **Scalability**: Adapt to peak booking traffic.
  - **Reliability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
  - **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data and ensure General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.
  - **Usability**: Simple interface with fast task completion.
  - **Response Time**: Search results within 2 seconds.


## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help illustrate the functionality of the system from the user's perspective, making it easier to identify and understand requirements.
**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams**:
  - **Clarity**: Simplifies complex systems by visualizing interactions.
  - **Communication**: Bridges understanding between stakeholders and developers.
  - **Requirement Verification**: Ensures all necessary functionalities are accounted for.
