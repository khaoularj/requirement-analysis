# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on mastering Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It includes documentation, diagrams, and structured requirements for a booking management system, emphasizing clarity, precision, and alignment with business goals. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for successful project execution through real-world application of requirement analysis principles.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a key phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where project needs are gathered, documented, and analyzed to define the scope and objectives clearly. It ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and potential challenges.

It is important because of its:
  - **Clarity**: Defines precise expectations and project scope.
  - **Risk Reduction**: Identifies issues early, avoiding costly changes later.
  - **Efficiency**: Guides development with clear requirements, reducing errors.
  - **Alignment**: Ensures software meets user needs and business goals.
  - **Testing Support**: Simplifies test case creation and product validation.
